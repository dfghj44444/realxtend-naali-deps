PythonQt
--------

PythonQt is a dynamic Python (http://www.python.org) binding for Qt (http://www.trolltech.com).
It offers an easy way to embed the Python scripting language into
your Qt applications. It makes heavy use of the QMetaObject system and thus requires Qt4.x.

Licensing of PythonQt
---------------------
PythonQt is distributed under the LGPL license.

Licensing of Generator
----------------------
The build system of PythonQt makes use of a patched version of the GPL'ed QtScript generator,
located in the "generator" directory.

See http://labs.trolltech.com/page/Projects/QtScript/Generator for details of the original project.

The PythonQt wrappers generated by the generator are distributed under the LGPL, they are not restriced by the GPL.

The generated wrappers are pre-generated and checked-in for Qt 4.4.3, so you only need to build and run the
generator when you want to build additional wrappers or you want to upgrade/downgrade to an newer Qt version.
