1. Download http://realxtend-naali.googlecode.com/files/tundra-vc2010-deps.7z

2. Extract to for example VC2010 folder here. It would be a bad idea to extract directly 
   here as it will overwrite and mix up with VC9 deps, as the directory structure is exactly the same.

3. Open readme from the extracted on how to use the deps with Tundra.
