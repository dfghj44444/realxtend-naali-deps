telepathy-qt4 0.1.8 (2009-06-16)
================================

The "Every Good Boy Deserves Frontalot" release.

New API:

* Added PendingChannelRequest class to be used when requesting channels using
  ChannelDispatcher through Account.
* Added Account methods to request/create channels using ChannelDispatcher
  (ensureTextChat, ensureTextChatroom, ensureMediaCall, createChannel and
  ensureChannel)

Enhancements:

* Updated to telepathy-spec 0.17.26

Fixes:

* ChannelDispatchOperation: Read Channels property instead of incorrectly
  reading ChannelDetailsList (Patch from George Kiagiadakis
  <kiagiadakis.george@gmail.com>).

telepathy-qt4 0.1.7 (2009-06-02)
================================

The "approver" release.

New API:

* Added Client Approver support.
* Added ChannelDispatchOperation high-level class.

Bugfixes:

* Fixed bug 21988: Channel does not work properly if the parent
  connection object is not ready
* Fixed bug 21993: TextChannel does not become ready until first message is
  received if FeatureMessageQueue is enabled.

telepathy-qt4 0.1.6 (2009-05-28)
================================

The "So hot, I have a fever" release.

New API:

* Added Channel::immutableProperties public method.

Enhancements:

* Added ChannelFactory, internal class to create channels based on
  their types.
* PendingChannel: Use ChannelFactory to create channels.

Bugfixes:

* Proper define AbstractClientPtr.
* ClientRegistrar: Fixed Observer adaptor introspection data.
* ClientRegistrar: Use ChannelFactory to create Channels.

telepathy-qt4 0.1.5 (2009-05-19)
================================

The "do not look at the conductor" release.

New API:

* Added Client support (Handler, Observer).
  * Added ClientRegistrar, class responsible for registering clients and proper
    exporting their D-Bus interfaces.
  * Added AbstractClientObserver, AbstractClientApprover (skeleton) and
    AbstractClientHandler. Clients should inherit one or some combination of
    these, by using multiple inheritance, and register themselves using
    ClientRegistrar::registerClient() in order to become a Client.

* Added ChannelRequest high-level class.

telepathy-qt4 0.1.4 (2009-05-08)
================================

The "global military-industrial complex is subsidising your iPod" release.

Dependencies:

* Creating accounts, and possibly updating their parameters, now requires an
  AccountManager implementing telepathy-spec 0.17.24, such as
  telepathy-mission-control >= 5.0.beta70 (in particular, beta 69 won't work,
  and the KWallet-based account manager will also need updating)

API changes:

* Renamed SharedData header file to RefCounted to follow class name.

New API:

* Update to telepathy-spec 0.17.24, breaking some D-Bus APIs:
  * fd.o #21619: Account::updateParameters() returns a PendingStringList of
    the parameters that won't be changed until reconnection takes place
  * Account::reconnect() added (newer MC versions don't violate telepathy-spec
    by reconnecting automatically when parameters are changed)
  * AccountManager::supportedAccountProperties() added
  * AccountManager::createAccount() takes an optional dict of properties
    (the valid keys are in supportedAccountProperties())

* Enhance PendingStringList to have a constructor from a QDBusPendingCall

Bugfixes:

* Don't try to run Python tests unless we have the gobject module (the tests
  use it)

telepathy-qt4 0.1.3 (2009-04-22)
================================

The "what are you scared of?" release.

Dependencies:

* Full regression tests now require telepathy-glib >= 0.7.28 (telepathy-glib
  is still optional)

API changes:

* Namespace simplification: Telepathy::Client::Channel (etc.) are now
  Tp::Channel, similar to telepathy-glib's TpChannel. Auto-generated client
  classes like Telepathy::Client::ChannelInterface are now
  Tp::Client::ChannelInterface.

* AccountManager, Account, ConnectionManager, Connection, Channel and Channel
  subclasses now inherit from Tp::RefCounted and are used together with
  Tp::SharedPtr/Tp::WeakPtr, shared and weak pointer classes using ideas from
  Qt, glibmm, Boost and WebKit. The constructor is now protected (in order to
  support custom classes) and a public create method that returns a SharedPtr
  was added. This is an attempt to avoid memory leaks as much as possible, see
  http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/telepathy/2009-March/003218.html for
  more details.

* Instead of forward-declaring Telepathy::Client::Channel and using
  a variable of type Telepathy::Client::Channel *, you should now include
  <TelepathyQt4/Types> and use either Tp::ChannelPtr, which is a
  reference-counted shared pointer, or Tp::WeakPtr<Tp::Channel>, which is the
  weak counterpart.
* Header simplification: the public headers now look like
  <TelepathyQt4/Channel>, i.e. without the Client subdirectory.

* PendingHandles now finish successfully on non fatal errors (InvalidArgument,
  InvalidHandle, NotAvailable). PendingHandles::invalidNames/invalidHandles
  should be used to check if a non-fatal error occurred and some handle could
  not be acquired.

Enhancements:

* Updated to telepathy-spec 0.17.23

* TelepathyQt4Farsight is a new mini-library with glue code to connect
  telepathy-farsight to Telepathy-Qt4. Handlers for streamed media channels
  with media signalling can #include <TelepathyQt4/Farsight/Channel> and pass
  their Tp::StreamedMediaChannel to Tp::createFarsightChannel, then hook up
  the resulting TfChannel to a GStreamer pipeline of their choice.

* StreamedMediaChannel has a new handlerStreamingRequired method so you can
  check whether the handler needs to carry out the streaming

* fd.o #21336: Channels now indicate whether a message is expected when
  doing various Group operations

* fd.o #21337: Account supports the new HasBeenOnline property

Fixes:

* fd.o #20583: Contact objects don't work without the Contacts interface.

* fd.o #20584: Contact object creation doesn't survive bad IDs or handles.

telepathy-qt4 0.1.2 (2009-03-23)
================================

The "robotic automatic hoover" release.

Dependencies:

* Full regression tests now require telepathy-glib >= 0.7.27 (telepathy-glib
  is still optional)

* telepathy-farsight >= 0.0.4 is a new optional dependency

API changes:

* AccountManager, Account, ConnectionManager, Connection, Channel
  now inherit QSharedData and are used together with
  QExplicitlySharedDataPointer.
  This is needed so we can create shared pointers based on the object itself,
  instead of doing hacks to find the shared pointer related to a given object.
  See http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/telepathy/2009-March/003168.html for
  more details.

* Channel Features are now Feature objects, not integers

* The Feature class is now in its own header, <TelepathyQt4/Feature>

Enhancements:

* The skeletal StreamedMediaChannel class from 0.1.0 has been expanded to
  cover all the functionality of the Telepathy StreamedMedia interface

* PendingConnection, PendingAccount etc. have busName and objectPath
  methods where necessary, so that objects of custom classes can be
  constructed

* Features can now be considered critical, meaning that failure to set them up
  leads to failure of becomeReady() - this should only be used for features
  that should never fail unless the service is buggy, like Connection and
  Channel core functionality

* examples/call/ is an example of how to use StreamedMediaChannel, which can
  make and receive XMPP Jingle calls using telepathy-gabble
  (this feature requires telepathy-farsight and GStreamer)

Fixes:

* When introspection of a Feature fails, the D-Bus error is propagated as the
  failure reason of becomeReady()

* Fix a memory leak in TextChannel

telepathy-qt4 0.1.1 (2009-03-05)
================================

The "PresencePublicationAuthorizationRequestRejection" release.

API changes:

* PendingReadyAccount, PendingReadyAccountManager, PendingReadyConnection,
  PendingReadyConnectionManager have all been replaced by the PendingReady
  class

* Account, AccountManager, Connection and ConnectionManager features are now
  QSet<uint>, not bitfields

* Plural contacts are generally represented by a QSet<QSharedPointer<Contact> >
  instead of a QList<QSharedPointer<Contact> > (with a new typedef,
  Telepathy::Client::Contacts, which must be used in signal/slot connections)

Enhancements:

* Added Connection::FeatureRoster, which, when enabled, adds contact list
  (a.k.a. roster/buddy list) functionality to the ContactManager and
  Contact objects

* Improved maintainability of Account, AccountManager, Connection and
  ConnectionManager becoming ready

* A QSharedPointer<Contact> is now hashable with qHash, meaning contacts can
  be QSet or QHash members

* Added a trivial contact list user interface, examples/roster/roster

Fixes:

* The client library no longer attempts to enforce group add/remove flags:
  whatever change the user requests is passed on to the connection manager
  (which might reject it)

* PendingReady objects returned by Connection::becomeReady() have the
  Connection as parent, rather than an internal object that isn't useful
  to library users

telepathy-qt4 0.1.0 (2009-02-26)
================================

The "pending operation" release.

This first release of telepathy-qt4 features high-level API for the following:

* Manipulating accounts on a Telepathy AccountManager implementation as
  described by telepathy-spec 0.17.x, such as Mission Control 5 (beta versions
  currently available)

* Manipulating Telepathy connection managers via the ConnectionManager and
  Connection core API

* Setting your own presence on a connection manager supporting the
  SimplePresence interface

* Requesting channels from a connection manager supporting the Requests
  interface

* Reading contacts' aliases etc. on a connection manager supporting the
  Contacts interface

* Sending and receiving messages on Text channels, with or without the
  Messages interface

In addition, lower-level auto-generated accessors are provided for all the
functionality of telepathy-spec version 0.17.19.

Notable functionality that is currently missing, but will be added soon,
includes:

* Manipulating a server-stored contact list

* Controlling VoIP calls in StreamedMedia channels
